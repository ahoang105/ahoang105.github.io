**Book Title:** A Course in Machine Learning

**My thought on this book:** Machine learning is a powerful and highly efficient tool in Big Data to deal with the large volume and high-velocity properties of big data. When dealing with big data, sometimes itâ€™s better to let the mathematical algorithm do the job than to run hundreds of models. Machine learning comes in handy by helping us explore big data in a faster way and more actionable way. Thus, I believe, this book will help me understand more about the mechanism of machine learning and how to apply it in future work or empirical research.
