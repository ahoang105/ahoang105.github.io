1. **Data Set**
- **Dataset name:** Google Research’s Open Covid-19 Data 
- **Online Access:** https://github.com/google-research/open-covid-19-data
- **Type:** Time series data for Covid-19. 
- **Variables:** 
    - This dataset includes variables such as cases, death, tests, hospitalization, discharges, intensive care unit cases, government interventions, and Google’s community Mobility Reports and Search Trends symptoms dataset which is aggregated in different locations including cities and counties. 
    
- **Potential application and values:**
    - This is a well-organized dataset so that all variables are defined and aggregated. Thus, we don’t have to spend a lot of time collecting and cleaning the dataset. 
In addition, including locations helps us to form useful knowledge about what is going on with the Covid situation in different locations. 
     - Using the variation from different locations we can also perform a time series analysis that can help us predict the trend of Covid cases and identify the most affected regions. Another implication of this data is that it can be used to evaluate the effectiveness of vaccinations or booster shots by comparing the number of cases for counties and cities with high rates of vaccinations and those with a lower rate. 

2. **Free Data Science Book**
- **Book Title:** A Course in Machine Learning
- **Author:** Hal Daume

- **My thought on this book:** Machine learning is a powerful and highly efficient tool in Big Data to deal with the large volume and high-velocity properties of big data. When dealing with big data, sometimes it’s better to let the mathematical algorithm do the job than to run hundreds of models. Machine learning comes in handy by helping us explore big data in a faster way and more actionable way. Thus, I believe, this book will help me understand more about the mechanism of machine learning and how to apply it in future work or empirical research.
